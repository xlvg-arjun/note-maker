# Note Maker Application

How to use?

Clone this repository. Each chapter's notes are to be created as a file bearing the numerical order of the Chapter, placed into the chapters directory of the src folder. Chapter 1 would be '1.mdx'

**This project makes use of MDX, Webpack, and React as the primary technologies**

You're to add any page that doesn't fit the chapters description into any other location, one suggested location is the other-notes folder. And then, the note is to be manually linked as a route in the index.jsx file, and as a route-link in the sidebar in the sidebar component
